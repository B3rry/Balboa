# Balboa

Balboa is a Python based bot that enables reddit.com's subreddit administrators to define, manage, and automate the process of handling changes to a user's flair. Features include the automatic handling and construction of flair text and CSS changes, including the dynamic constructions of these values via regex and time-based restrictions.

Balboa was initially created for [/r/survivor](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor) by [/u/gariond](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gariond) on behalf of [/u/aksurvivorfan](https://www.reddit.com/user/aksurvivorfan). Special thanks to GitHub user [gavin19](https://github.com/gavin19) for his work on [`gavin19/reddit-flair-bot`](https://github.com/gavin19/reddit-flair-bot), whose work this is bot is based upon.

### Reddit Configuration
1. [Create a reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/register/) that the bot will use to sign in
> Note: This bot's reddit account **_must_** be given `wiki` and `flair` moderation permissions on the subreddit you intend to have the bot manage.
2. [Register your bot](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) on Reddit's Application Preferences management page. Obtain an `APP_ID`, and `APP_SECRET`
    * Click `create another appâ€¦` on the bottom of the page to begin the registration process
    > Note: You'll need to select a type of `script` from the radio options under the 'create application' prompt  
    * The `about url` field should contain a link to a wiki page on your subreddit about the bot you've created
    * The `redirect uri` needs to be a valid url, it's suggested to use the url of your subreddit
