# ============= Message Receiver .py ============= #
# Currently, Message Receiver handles the retrieval of messages from the inbox
# of the bot's Reddit account using PRAW. We treat _all_ incoming requests that
# could potentially trigger an action as a "message." Right now, each individual
# "reciever" handles the dispatching of its own action requests. This should be
# a workflow of standardization and "pass-along" to the `ActionRequest` process.
# Note that `ActionRequest` should define the protocol for handling messages as
# it relates to determination of action, autorization and negotiated responseâ€¦
# this work should only facilitate that handoff.
#
# The long term vision for this code is to handle the management of all incoming
# data. This solution will need to:
# [ ] Handle incoming messages sent via the Slack API by way of the flask
#     > Do we achieve this by just instantiating the flask API under its reciever?
# [ ] Handle frequent, repeated requests to the Reddit API to check for messages
# [ ] Exist, or augment the current `bot.py` loop model. *Big implications*
#
# [TODO]: Standardize the handling of various messaging integrations within this dir. Treat message-receiver as the way to initiate a dispatch.
